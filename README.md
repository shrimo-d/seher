# seher

Seher is an experiment in writing reinforcement learning and optimal control
software using Python 3.12, relying heavily on generics.

This software is aimed at people that need to build robust and reliable
autonomous systems, and want to know how doing so can be done with a modern
approach in Python engineering.

Some guiding principles.

 - Write Python like it's rust.
 - Rely on protocols/jax-transformable dataclasses as much as possible,
   keep implicit semantics of array dimensions minimal.
 - Type annotation and testing, including performance tests.
 - No explicit parallelization, all done with jax primitives.
 - Maximum reuse of already existing tooling such as equinox, optax, etc.
 - Minimal UI, just some rudimentary console plots using plotext. Easy to
   add them through a callback interface.

Some features.

 - MPC with a derivative-free optimizer, MPPI.
 - Policy search and actor critic based on analytic gradients.
 - Policy gradients based on score function estimation.
 - Interface to mujoco_playground.

 # installation

 this version uses a fork of mujoco_playground with a custom environment (link missing). For this to work, mujoco and mujoco-mjx need to be reverted to 3.5.0!


## Roadmap

- Milestone "Stochastic Policies"
  - [ ] Make it more generic such that it is not only about Gaussian policies.
- Milestone "Features"
  - MPPI
    - [ ] respect control spaces (fit a truncated gaussian)
- Milestone "Stepper"
  - [ ] Find a way that using the specific carries in subclasses of Stepper
        classes can be used, and type checkers don't complain. Right now, we
        need to use the super class in the signature, and then cast to the
        subclass in the method.
  - [ ] Make `problem_data` optional for optimizers
  - [ ] add an option to also vmap the random keys during Optimizer steps
- Milestone "Quality"
  - [ ] Make the initial state show up in histories, currently it does not.
  - [ ] Make sure histories have the right shapes (can be done with the one
        before this)
  - [ ] Make RichProgressCallback not based on policies (the variable names
        indicate it)
  - [ ] The seher.control.{actor_critic,policy_search} modules need some
        unification, they have different architectures. also, some functions
        from the latter are used in the former.
  - [ ] Remove double sampling in TanhGaussianPolicyMDP by ensuring cost()
        uses the same control sample as transit() instead of sampling twice
- Milestone "Policy search"
- Milestone "Actor-Critic"
  - [ ] undo relaxation of performance tests in 6bcaa44.
  - [ ] implement a variant that can use ARS for mujoco_playground
        environments; here is a breakdown
        - refactor actor critic such that it has a policy objective and
          a crtic objective.
        - the former produces a history as its auxiliary and this can then
          be passed to the latter
        - both also get two different optimizers which produce steps--here
          the policy can get an ARS-based optimiser and the critic one using
          ordinary gradients
- Milestone "Constrained control"
  - [ ] Make a stepper that can work with cost and constraints
  - [ ] Add a simple constrained mdp, e.g. point in a box or so
  - PolicySearch
     - [ ] Add a stepper that trains a policy on constrained MDPs
     - [ ] Make it work and add a performance test!
  - MPC
     - [ ] Extend MPC with constraints
     - [ ] Make it work and add a performance test!
- Milestone "Partial observability"
  - [ ] Add a StateEstimator/Filter protocol
  - [ ] Add a challenging but simple POMDP
  - [ ] Add/extend the simulate function to work with POMDPs and state
        estimators
  - PolicySearch
     - [ ] Add a stepper that trains a recurrent policy
     - [ ] Make it work and add a performance test!
  - MPC
     - [ ] Extend MPC with Filters
     - [ ] Make it work and add a performance test!
- Milestone "Newton RL"
- Milestone "Model learning"
- Milestone "Adaptive control"
- Milestone "Maximum entropy control"
